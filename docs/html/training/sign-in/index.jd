  The Google+ platform for Android lets you authenticate a user with the same credentials they use
  on Google every day. Once a user signs in with Google, you can create more engaging experiences
  and drive usage of your app.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/">Google+ Android API</a> allows
  you to integrate sign-in and social features into your app.

<h2 id="features">Key Developer Features</h2>

<h4>Trusted authentication</h4>
<p>
  Google+ Sign-In is a simple, trusted, and secure way to let people sign in to your app with their
  Google credentials and bring along their Google+ info.<br>

<h4>Access the profile and social graph</h4>
<p>
  Once users have signed in with Google, your app can welcome them by name, display their picture,
  connect them with friends, and lots more.<br>

  social graph</a>.
</p>

<h4>Stand out in the stream</h4>
<p>
  Interactive posts is a rich way of sharing to Google+. It lets users prompt friends to take
  specific actions in your app from a Google+ post, like "listen," "RSVP," "check-in," and over 100
  more actions.<br>

</p>

<h4>Recommend content</h4>
<p>
  Add a native +1 button so users can recommend content from your app. These endorsements can give
  your app more credibility and help it grow faster.<br>
